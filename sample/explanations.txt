The Flask API serves an HTML page at the root URL and provides a JSON API at /api/data that fetches data from an SQLite database.

The SQLite database stores your data. You can replace SQLite with another database if you prefer.

The HTML/CSS provides the structure and style of your webpage.

The JavaScript fetches data from your API and uses D3.js to visualize it.
