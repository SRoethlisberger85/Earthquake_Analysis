# Earthquake_Analysis

This project aims to illustrate an in-depth analysis of earthquake frequency and severity in particular areas and show how the aftermath affects the surrounding environment and community.
-This is still an alpha version. We are trying to figure out the bugs with the app.py not showing our visualizations. If you would like to see the visualizations please look to the earthquakes folder in vs code, go live, and go to index3.html in the url. Thank you for being patient with us.

- Project Overview
  
    - Usage and installation instructions of libraries/tools that are used
      
      -The team pulled data from the year 1960-2023 from
       -The national centers for envirnmental administration under The Natioal Oceanic & Atmosphere administration
        This provided a great amount of information to link all of our primary focuses (Mortality, Suicides, and GDP) into one.

       -The World Health organization
         The WHO gave us the best possible information on suicides pertaining to Earthquakes
          suicide_data.csv from WHO (https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mental-health/suicide-rates)
       -The World Bank 
         The World Bank gave us the best possible information on GDP pertaining to Earthquakes

      -This team used the following scripts to create the dashboard

    - Intro (business question and motivation)
      -Our goal of this project was to try and link information from different national databases and create a cohesive dashboard that can help commmunities and business be more aware of the destruction earthquakes can         do. Some might give little to no damage but others can be devastating and it's important for cities to build their buildings stable enough to withstand the incredible force of earthquakes.
      
    - Project goals and how they are achieved
          -The goals for this team was to find information on mortality, suicides, and gdp of countries around the entire world affected by earthquakes. They were acheived by assigning each member an area of focus,                  pulling data from the databases above, using the libraries shown above, and creating maps, line graphs, and timelines. The team decided to choose from a few countries that had significant data found:
                -Haiti in 2010 had the most amount of deaths since 1960 totalling 316,000.
                -Chile in 1960 had the highest magnitude of 9.5
                -Japan in 1995 had the most amount of damages in millions totaling 100 billion.           
    - Analysis to support the visuals and findings
